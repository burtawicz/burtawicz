# Rick Burta

I - am a software engineer; love puzzles, patterns, and building things; have been obsessed with computers and AGI since I was a child. 
There's an indescribable sense of fulfillment that comes from solving a challenging puzzle, recognizing an abstract pattern, or combining raw elements and imagination into something that can better the lives of others. 
For the last 12+ years I've been helping organizations obtain that sense of fulfillment by designing resilient systems and developing scalable solutions to complex problems.
